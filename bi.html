            <h1>Bachelor of Innovation</h1>
            <p>
                The Bachelor of Innovation (BI) is a unique degree offered by
                the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). It is a
                fully accredited alternative to Bachelor of Science and Bachelor
                of Arts degrees, offering a wide selection of majors ranging
                from engineering to arts. The BI takes advantage of the
                major-spanning nature of a degree to create an interdisciplinary
                environment where students with diverse skills, backgrounds, and
                interests come together to work with real companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BI is based on the idea that the best way to learn is by
                doing. It combines traditional major-specific courses with
                project-based learning designed to prepare students for the
                working world. Within the BI, open electives are replaced by a
                set of eight innovation courses which bring students of all
                majors and years together to collaboratively apply innovation
                and entrepreneurship. These courses give students hands-on
                experience with business and intellectual property law, patent
                application development, grant proposal writing, and team-based
                innovation consulting for real-world organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Innovation is the transformation of ideas into impact. The BI
                gives students firsthand experience creating impact through a
                series of courses where students work in cross-functional
                interdisciplinary teams serving as innovation consultants for
                real-world clients. Teams work closely with clients throughout
                the semester to identify the goals of the client, develop a
                scope of work describing a set of concrete deliverables, and
                ultimately transform ideas into impact for the client. These
                team-based courses give students the opportunity to develop
                skills and strategies they can use to be effective members of
                professional teams after graduation, while simultaneously
                creating real value for clients.
