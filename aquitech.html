                            Aquitech was one of my business partner and my first serious attempts at making a game. Naturally, we decided that a session-based player-versus-player (PVP) online multiplayer game was a good place to start.

                            Going into this project, we had essentially no idea how multiplayer games worked. We had previously completed an online multiplayer pong prototype, but we were about to learn that there is a lot more to an online multiplayer game than netcode.

                            My primary contributions to this project were the building system, user interface, visuals, and networking infrastructure. I learned how to use several AWS services to build systems for cloud storage (S3), user management (DynamoDB), and game server hosting (GameLift). I used AWS Lambda functions and REST endpoints to interact with the backend from the game client. Aquitech ended up being my introduction to web development.
