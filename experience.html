                    Developed a Python program to automate parsing and cleaning
                    of heterogeneous sales data from third-party retailers,
                    saving up to 5 hours of manual work per week and processing
                    a 4-year backlog of over 1.5 million sales records

                    At the start of my internship, I was given a folder filled
                    with over 4 years of monthly sales report spreadsheets from
                    SRAM's 3rd party online retailer partners. The spreadsheets
                    contained similar information, but each retailer formatted
                    their reports differently. Additionally, as with any data
                    set, not all of the data was valid.

                    My job was to develop a program that would automatically
                    parse, clean, and export the data in a format that could be
                    ingested into SRAM's sales database systems. I created a
                    Python console application that used pattern matching and a
                    suite of data validation methods to process the reports,
                    outputting a CSV file containing clean data. After
                    extracting the data, I built a Power BI dashboard to enable
                    members of the sales team to explore the new dataset.
