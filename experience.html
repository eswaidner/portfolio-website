                    Graphic design is a skill I learned through game user
                    interface development. I got the opportunity to apply those
                    skills as a student employee at UCCS. I was in charge of the
                    Commode Chronicles, an on-campus ad publication released
                    every two weeks. The job was a combination of custom ad
                    design, working with community members, and upholding UCCS
                    brand standards.
