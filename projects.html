                    BFNI is a not-for-profit dedicated to supporting Bahamian

                    As part of my final BI teams course, I co-led a team of
                    students providing innovation consulting services to BFNI.
                    Our team was brought in to help BFNI establish the digital
                    infrastructure they need to execute on their fundraising
                    strategy. We overhauled the

                    the website content. We also set up social media accounts
                    and developed recommendations for how BFNI could use the new
                    infrastructure to support their goals.

                    AAA Medicaid Consulting is a local Colorado Springs small
                    business dedicated to providing personalized Medicaid
                    consulting services that help citizens get the most out of
                    Medicaid. AAA Medicaid Consulting was seeking investment in
                    order to expand their operations.

                <p>
                    I was a member of the BI innovation consulting team that
                    worked with AAA Medicaid to help them grow. Our team's main
                    focus was creating data-backed visual resources that
                    communicated the value of AAA Medicaid's services. We
                    delivered a professionally designed PowerPoint and trifold
                    pamphlet that AAA Medicaid could utilize in meetings with
                    investors and potential clients.
