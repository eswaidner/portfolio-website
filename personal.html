            <p>
                I’ve always had an innate drive to do things my own way. When I
                was 5 years old, I decided I wanted to open a lemonade stand. My
                parents directed me to come up with a bill of materials,
                expecting lemons, sugar, etcetera. The initial item on my list
                was wood, because in my mind, the first step was building a
                table - one that would be ideally suited for lemonade sales.
                I’ve changed a lot since then, but my unique approach to life
                has remained the same.

                The projects I am most passionate about are those that redefine
                the status quo in pursuit of simplifying what was previously
                complex. I’m never afraid to take the harder path if I believe
                there is something to be gained. I’ve iterated on 3d modeling
                systems, game engines, and programming languages all in pursuit
                of creating simpler workflows. My assumptions are not always
                accurate and I’ve failed more times than I can recall, but I’ve
                learned from everything I’ve attempted.

                Taking the road less traveled is rife with challenges.
                Sometimes, the best table for the lemonade stand is the one that
                already exists. Over time, I have gotten better at deciding when
                to reinvent and when to build upon pre-existing work. I expect
                that I will never stop striving to find a balance, but
                ultimately, I wouldn’t have it any other way. The root of all
                innovation is the ability to reimagine what already exists.
