                            Bahamas Feeding Network International (BFNI) is a
                            not-for-profit dedicated to supporting Bahamian
                            organizations fighting against hunger. To advance
                            their mission, BFNI is expanding fundraising efforts
                            beyond the Bahamas through an online grassroots
                            campaign.

                            As part of my final BI teams course, I co-led a team
                            of six students providing innovation consulting
                            services to BFNI. Our team was brought in to help
                            BFNI establish the digital infrastructure they need
                            to execute on their fundraising strategy. We

                            streamlining the website content. We also set up
                            social media accounts and developed recommendations
                            for how BFNI could use the new infrastructure to
                            support their goals.

                        <p>
                            AAA Medicaid Consulting is a local Colorado Springs
                            small business dedicated to providing personalized
                            Medicaid consulting services that help citizens get
                            the most out of Medicaid. AAA Medicaid Consulting
                            was seeking investment in order to expand their
                            operations.

                        <p>
                            I was a member of the BI innovation consulting team
                            that worked with AAA Medicaid to help them grow. Our
                            team's main focus was creating data-backed visual
                            resources that communicated the value of AAA
                            Medicaid's services. We delivered a professionally
                            designed PowerPoint and trifold pamphlet that AAA
                            Medicaid could utilize in meetings with investors
                            and potential clients.
