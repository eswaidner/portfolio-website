            <h1>Innovation Statement</h1>
            <p>
                Innovation is the transformation of ideas into impact.
                Transforming an idea into impact is an iterative process
                composed of observation, conjecture, experimentation, and
                reflection - an application of the scientific method. Every
                iteration explores solutions to obstacles standing between the
                current state and the desired impact. In my experience, the
                faster and cheaper a team can iterate, the better the end
                product will be. I believe a key factor in moving fast is having
                a deep understanding of the tools being used.

                I find great joy in solving complicated problems using simple
                tools. The process of understanding the fundamental elements of
                a system and then figuring out how to apply them to a real-world
                problem is extremely fulfilling, especially when coupled with a
                rapid and low-consequence feedback loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software is the ideal medium for this type of problem solving; a
                self-contained platform created for and by humans.
                Unfortunately, I rarely experience that sort of creative freedom
                in the modern world of software development. While building
                software has never been easier in terms of readily available
                technology and knowledge, the overwhelming complexity, coupled
                with the inherently challenging nature of product development,
                makes creating quality products extremely difficult in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development is often a process of stitching together fragile,
                complex systems in the name of not reinventing the wheel, only
                to have to expand the logic of the application to work around
                issues and sub-optimal design choices introduced by those
                systems. Every project has unique constraints and needs, and
                trying to assemble applications from large pre-built solutions
                designed in isolation from the problem at hand is a nontrivial
                and often frustrating process. The feeling of working against
                tools rather than with them introduces friction which hampers
                creativity, inhibits developing a deep understanding of the
                system, and ultimately leads to worse products and reduced
                impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                My mission as an innovator is to share the joy of simplicity by
                building reliable, intuitive, and frictionless systems that
                empower people to create quality products. I want to build
                infrastructure that enables others to express their creativity
                and gives them the tools to focus on realizing their unique
                ideas. To me, there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing
                someone benefit from a system that I helped build. I believe
                tools have a multiplicative effect on the impact teams can
                create, and that using high-quality tools can be extremely
                beneficial to the success and sustainability of any project.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hard part is designing high-quality tools. Developers often
                reach for complex solutions to address complex problems. I
                believe that the more complex a problem is, the more important
                the simplicity of the tools becomes. As projects grow in scope
                and lifespan, the negative effects of complex tools compound.
                Developers have a finite amount of mental bandwidth, and every
                bit of effort dedicated to using tools is a bit diverted from
                solving the problem at hand and creating value for end users. In
                my experience, high-quality tools present the essential building
                blocks needed to efficiently solve problems, leaving developers
                to compose those blocks along with their own abstractions to
                solve their specific problem.
            </p>

                Software exists to bridge the gap between human intention and
                computer execution, allowing people to harness the power of
                digital computation to create real-world impact. Every software
                product is built upon layers of abstraction that expose
                increasingly higher-level interfaces. The intention of this
                model is to allow developers to work using the level of
                abstraction that best suits their specific application while
                efficiently reusing underlying systems. Each layer's interface
                represents the core capabilities of the system, making minimal
                assumptions about how those capabilities will be used by
                developers. In my opinion, this is the design philosophy that
                creates the best tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to study the problems encountered in my own projects
                as well as problems encountered by my coworkers and team
                members, reduce them to their fundamental parts, and develop
                generalized interfaces that cleanly abstract away some of the
                complexity of software development, leaving simple tools ready
                to be mastered. In a world increasingly filled with complexity,
                I believe a conscious pursuit of simplicity is not just a
                desirable goal, but a necessary one. Simplicity paves the way
                for innovation, empowering people to take full control of their
                tools, iterate quickly, and ultimately, transform their ideas
                into impact.
